A Discord moderator bot, designed to be used with the Stardew Valley server


## Overview

This bot was originally written to assist with moderation on the SDV Discord server, but it can be easily used on any server that requires more advanced moderation logging.

My personal hosting of the bot will be private, but users are free to host a version of the bot themselves. Over time, the bot has become more and more specific to the SDV server, so this repo is here more as an example rather than a resource to be directly used by others.

## Features

The bot has several moderation features:

- Logging of user warnings
    - Moderators can log user warnings alongside an explanitory message.
    - Warnings are saved both in a channel specified in `config.json`, as well as saved to a local database.
    - In addition to warnings; bans, kicks, and unbannings can all be noted.
- Storing moderation notes
    - Notes about users are stored privately, for moderators to review later
- User searching
    - The database can be searched by user ID, username or by 'ping'. The bot will then post any noted infractions, as well as their timestamp and stored message
- Removal
    - Everybody makes mistakes. Individual user logs can be specified and deleted.
- DM forwarding
    - Private messages sent to the bot will be automatically forwarded to the channel specified in `config.json`.
    - Moderators can also DM a user via the bot, allowing for collaborative viewing of direct messages.
    - DMs from unruly users can be blocked and unblocked as desired.
    - All DMs are also saved to a local .txt file for easy review.
- User DMing
    - Upon being banned, there is the option to DM a user with the ban message. This can be disabled by setting the "DM" field in `config.json` to false.
- Statistics visualization
    - Statistics about moderator activity can be generated, namely how many warns/bans occurred each month, and how many total warns/bans have been created by each moderator.
- Sorted review
    - All users with logs over a specified timespan can be posted, for moderation review.
- System logs
    - The bot will also monitor all channels and post server-wide changes in users.
    - These include nickname changes, joining, leaving, kicked, banned, joining/leaving VC, and logging of all deleted and modified messages.

There is also a `$help` command, which will give the syntax for all of the previously listed commands

For better security, the bot only listens in specific channels for commands, and only accepts commands for users with specific roles. These can be specified, along with other parameters, in the `config.json` file. This is not included for obvious reasons, and a template is currently not stored due to the fact I am lazy.
